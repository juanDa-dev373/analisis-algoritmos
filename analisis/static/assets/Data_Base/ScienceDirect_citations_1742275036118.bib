abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the application of AI robots (Artificial Intelligence-based robots) for instruction has become an attractive research topic. Numerous studies have shown that AI robots may provide new opportunities for learning designs in school settings or professional training. However, there is no review examining the role and research foci of AI-Robots in Education (AIRE) research. This study therefore explored the research trends of AIRE by conducting a systematic review of SSCI (Social Sciences Citation Index) journal articles published in the Web of Science (WoS). The study analyzed the participants, duration of the studies, learning environments, application domains, data analysis, evaluations of learners' performance, learning strategies, roles of AI-robots, and research issues. The research findings are concluded as follows: (1) The countries of Canada, Chile, and South Korea invested in AIRE research early, and focused on students' learning performance and learning behavior. (2) Most AIRE research focuses on research targets under the age of 13 and completed experiments within 4 weeks in a physical environment. Most AIRE research has been applied in the disciplines of Language and Science, and problem-solving related strategies and mixed strategies are the most commonly used strategies. (3) AI-robots are often applied and regarded as tutees or tutors. Regardless of what the AI-robot's role is, learning performance is the most widely focused variable in AIRE research. Furthermore, attitudes, opinions of learners or learning perceptions and learning behavior are other frequently discussed themes. To sum up, this study makes several recommendations for AIRE research for educators, researchers, and policy makers in higher education settings as a reference based on the results.}

However, due to their complexity, understanding underlying developmental mechanisms is challenging. Elsewhere in neurobiology, a computational revolution has shown that mathematical models of hidden biological mechanisms can bridge observations with theory building. Can we build a similar computational framework yielding mechanistic insights for brain development? Here, we outline the conceptual and technical challenges of addressing this theory gap, and demonstrate that there is great potential in specifying brain development as mathematically defined processes operating within physical constraints. We provide examples, alongside broader ingredients needed, as the field explores computational explanations of system-wide development.}

Although the support provided through curricula in schools develops these skills to a certain extent, digital divide still exists for individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics. The concept of digital divide, used to define individuals who do not have equal access to digital technologies, has started to be seen as a determining factor for digital competencies with its expanding scope. The current study aims to take a perspective to investigate the effect of socio-demographic variables, which may cause digital divide, on students' ICT literacy. With this study, it is sought to explain the effect of current inequalities regarding digital access on students' ICT skills. To this end, the socio-demographic characteristics of the students in the sample of Korea and Chile from the participating countries of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) were examined in the context of ICT literacy. The characteristics of the models created were compared for both countries. While parents’ level of education variable stands out for the Chilean model, the internet connection variable is remarkable for the Korean model. It is anticipated that the findings of the research will contribute to understanding the dynamics of the digital divide and its possible consequences, and can be a source for preventive policy steps to be developed.}

However, a theory-driven scale to extend empowerment into the use of AI for problem-solving is lacking. This study developed and validated an 11-item scale of empowerment in using AI for problem-solving (EUAIPS) based on a proposed conceptual framework that synthesises empowerment and AI-related literature. The EUAIPS scale encompasses impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness in using AI for problem-solving. We collected data from a diverse sample of Hong Kong senior secondary and university students before (N = 477) and after the course (N = 409). Results demonstrated that the EUAIPS scale with a three-factor structure had good reliability and validity. Students also felt significantly more empowered to use AI for problem-solving after a 14-h course using AI for problem-solving. These findings empirically support the affective dimension of AI literacy and show that psychological control/competence is particularly important for students to harness AI to solve problems at the affective level. This study presents a valid instrument for researchers and practitioners to measure empowerment in using AI for problem-solving and informs AI literacy curriculum designers about including learning activities to help students realise its impact, self-efficacy, and meaningfulness.}

Many guidelines for ethical and responsible computing have been developed in response. Dominant approaches typically attribute liability and blame to individual companies or actors, rather than understanding how the working practices, norms, and cultural understandings in the software industry contribute to such outcomes. In this paper, we propose an understanding of responsibility that is infrastructural, relational, and cultural; thus, providing a foundation to better enable responsible software engineering into the future. Our approach draws on Young's (2006) social connection model of responsibility and Star and Ruhleder's (1994) concept of infrastructure. By bringing these theories together we introduce a concept called infrastructural injustice, which offers a new way for software engineers to consider their opportunities for responsible action with respect to society and the planet. We illustrate the utility of this approach by applying it to an Open-Source software communities’ development of Deepfake technology, to find key leverage points of responsibility that are relevant to both Deepfake technology and software engineering more broadly.}

This paper aims to center the experiences of three cohorts (n = 40) of Black high school students who participated in a critical race technology course that exposed anti-blackness as the organizing logic and default setting of digital and artificially intelligent technology. This paper centers the voices, experiences and technological innovations of the students, and in doing so, introduces a new type of digital literacy: critical race algorithmic literacy.
Design/methodology/approach
Data for this study include student interviews (called “talk backs”), journal reflections and final technology presentations.
Findings
Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world.
Originality/value
While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems.}

However, fostering robust social relationships among objects within intelligent environments requires considering a multitude of parameters, from historical transactions data to peer opinions on interaction experiences. Our primary objective is to introduce the VISO concept, a finely tuned approach for community formation and facilitating autonomous interactions among Social IoT objects. Key contributions of VISO include: (i) a recommendation mechanism for cultivating friendships; (ii) the virtualization of devices, known as Virtual Objects, based on the Digital Twin concept; (iii) object ranking, determined by peer evaluations at the edge; and (iv) profiling the identity of each object within the environment. The VISO approach is rooted in the link analysis model, which seeks to uncover connections between individuals and qualify interactions. Additionally, the construction of social circles is guided by the Organizational Network Analysis model, a concept grounded in social networks designed to simplify the initiation of new friendships. The VISO approach stands out through its amalgamation of dynamic trust mechanisms, object virtualization, real-time interaction monitoring, and the highlighting of the most active objects. These characteristics collectively contribute to its effectiveness in managing relationships within the social IoT, while simultaneously addressing challenges posed by alternative models. Preliminary results in a testing environment substantiate the model’s capability to categorize interactions and identify the most beneficial object roles for establishing new relationships. In particular, by selecting the most active objects 30%, they account for a staggering 90% of local actions. These validation outcomes lay the foundation for planned future work and enhancements to the VISO approach. Encouraged by the promising results, the inception of a significant project is on the horizon. The application of the VISO approach to relationship management within a smart campus for ubiquitous education underscores the remarkable versatility and potential of Social IoT. This application has the power to elevate various facets of campus life, ranging from education to resource management, creating a transformative impact within the educational landscape.}

This study explores the impact of providing players with the autonomy over the use of learning mechanic. Students interacted with two versions of a computer programming game prototype differing in the level of player agency in terms of freedom to employ the learning mechanics during gameplay. We employed quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate if player agency affected students’ learning outcomes, game enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation to learn. The results have implications for design of educational games, suggesting that incorporating player agency, particularly in the context of choosing learning mechanics, can enhance enjoyment and intrinsic motivation without compromising the educational effectiveness of the game.}

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12.
Aims
This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment.
Sample
One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72).
Methods
Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance.
Results
The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety.
Conclusions
The DCP approach significantly improved students’ learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education.}

abstract = {Background
In the etiology of functional chest pain (FCP), parental personality traits are worth considering in the context of the biopsychosocial model. The αlpha factor sub-dimension of the five-factor personality model (5FPM) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. There is increasing evidence that this dimension may be related to psychosomatic diseases. It was aimed to investigate how maternal personality traits affect adolescents with FCP. The hypothesis was determined that adolescents diagnosed with FCP can have lower quality of life and be more depressive/anxious and their mothers can have factor-α personality traits and be more depressive/anxious.
Methods
The sample of this single-center, cross-sectional, case-control study consisted of 25 adolescents with FCP and their parents. The control group consisted of 35 age and sex matched healthy adolescents and their parents. Psychopathology was screened using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and KINDL forms were completed by the adolescents. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Five-Factor Personality Inventory short form (FFPI) were completed by the parents.
Results
Mothers of adolescents with FCP scored significantly higher compared with mothers of healthy controls in agreeableness and conscientiousness and scored significantly lower in neuroticism. Higher levels of mothers’ neuroticism scores were associated with higher CDI and STAI-1 scores in FCP group. Agreeableness (Exp (B) = 10.097; p = .004; confidence interval [CI] = 2.049-49.745) and conscientiousness (Exp (B) = 16.414; p = .011; CI = 1.902-141.682) were statiscally significant in regression model.
Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that mother's alpha factor personality traits may be one of the factors that contribute to the presence of FCP.}

In this paper it is argued that a re-interpretation of Turing's work is required to underpin theorizing about cognitive architecture. It is claimed that the symbol systems view of the mind, which is the conventional way of understanding how Turing's work impacts on cognitive science, is deeply flawed. There is an alternative interpretation that is more faithful to Turing's original insights, avoids the criticisms made of the symbol systems approach and is compatible with the growing interest in agent-environment interaction. It is argued that this interpretation should form the basis for theories of cognitive architecture.}

Already prior to this development, an increasing number of scholarly publications on the concept appeared. In this project, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify how DC has been operationalized in teaching practices to date. The findings reveal that DC is often used as an umbrella term for technology-related learning tasks that nevertheless fail to actively engage students in practicing DC in a critical manner. In addition, older students are often asked to develop DC in project-based learning outside the school setting. While interdisciplinary approaches to DC have been proposed, disciplines such as philosophy or ecology—apparently necessary to work on citizenship—are not considered. Finally, digital tools/environments are never questioned and always imposed; as such, a critical approach to DC is not explicitly developed in the classroom. This literature review discusses the practical implications of the current state of research.}

The pandemic has had serious ramifications for K-3 education, and the impact of distance learning on 21st century skill attainment are important issues to explore. Using the Saudi Arabia context, this paper investigates teachers’ perspectives regarding the implementation of online education to support 21st century skills in the COVID-19 pandemic era for K-3 elementary school students. A qualitative research methodology was applied in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted to collect data from five K-3 female teachers who implemented online education during the pandemic. Three themes emerged from the findings: 1) effects of the pandemic as related to online teaching for attainment of 21st century skills, 2) elaboration of best practices for online teaching to facilitate such attainment, and 3) challenges that exist for distance learning and student acquisition of 21st century skills. Therefore, the findings suggest that elementary teachers should find opportunities for elementary students to experience distance learning as an ongoing learning solution in order to incorporate innovative strategies that enhance their 21st century skills.}

It requires a new type of intelligence to deal with this fundamental change. This new type of intelligence requires new competencies. Yet, it is not crystal clear what these new competencies should be, especially those relating to the discipline of project management. Project leaders are required to implement and manage 4IR-related projects but do not necessarily have the required competencies. This is especially the case in a developing country such as South Africa. The study explored the digital competencies that are deemed important by project managers in managing projects in the digital economy. Q-methodology was used to determine potential perspectives, and three confirming perspectives and one emergent perspective were identified. The main competence deemed important is online communication and collaboration, whereas cybersecurity is deemed unimportant. This study is the first of its kind and provides insight into the digital intelligence of project leaders. It contributes to the current debate around the future digital competencies and skills that are required. It also provides guidelines for organisations on how to plan and structure training and to upskill their current project leaders. A concerted effort needs to be in place to upskill project leaders.

Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant. Our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. We expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience.}

Our key findings indicate the need to work in partnership with classroom teachers, providing both initial training and continued support. This will both result in more valuable research data, and address a gap in teachers’ continued professional development. The TTM aims to ensure that teachers, students, and researchers can benefit from innovative educational systems deployed in real classroom contexts. We believe that the TTM could be adapted to other domains of study within interaction design community. The paper goes on to argue the more general point that the interaction design and children community should shift emphasis away from technology innovation and towards reporting replicable longitudinal research findings from real-world settings. We discuss possible approaches to achieving this, for example through changes to reviewing criteria and by actively supporting data and source code sharing.}

The dispersion of knowledge of feature models hinders the study and reuse of these artefacts in different studies.

Open science principles promote transparency, accessibility, and collaboration in scientific research.

In addition, existing and public feature models are described using formats not always supported by current tools. This paper presents , a repository of feature models in UVL format. provides a front end that facilitates the search, upload, storage, and management of feature model datasets, improving the capabilities of discontinued proposals.

We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. Teacher-report child performance (N = 231) showed that the MM program resulted in significantly higher scores in children's STEM habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the MM program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. Our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young children's making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences. The makerspace further sets a solid foundation for the development of children's STEM thinking skills and socioemotional skills in a rapidly changing digital society.}

Google Earth Engine, and random forest algorithm, are used to generate a dataset that help to investigate this question. A regression is performed on double differenced data to investigate the effects of interest. A k-mean cluster analysis, is also used to determine whether the distribution patterns of crop production changed with drought and disruption of agricultural production input. Results show that: (1) droughts affected the agricultural production of both areas similarly. Crop cover declined in both areas for one season after droughts were broken. Then recovery was driven by greener, more productive crops rather than the expansion of crop area. (2) The response of both areas to the COVID-19 lockdown was also similar. Both smallholder and commercial areas' Normalised Difference Vegetation Index – a proxy for crop vitality – improved in response to regulations favourable to the sector and improved rainfall. No significant adjustments in crop cover were observed. Production therefore changed primarily at the intensive margin (improved productivity of existing croplands) rather than the extensive (changing the extent of land under cultivation). (3) Cluster analysis allows for a more granular view, showing that the positive impact of lockdowns on agriculture were concentrated in areas with high rainfall and close proximity to metropolitan markets. Both smallholder and commercial farmers therefore are reliant on market access together with favourable environmental conditions for improved production.}

This paper presents an investigation of fourth- and fifth-grade students engaging in Making activities to create simulation, concept-process, and illustrative models in the science classroom. Based on video analyses of the Making-based class sessions, a generalized process model was developed for each type of science model. In addition, cross-cutting themes were found in Making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for Making and modeling for Science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing Making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students’ overall engagement with science in the activity. We suggest that Making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their Making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between Making and science activity. We conclude that Making has the potential to support the development of scientific model thinking in the elementary science classroom, but much further research is needed in this area.}

Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures.}

Four aspects of psychological distance—temporal, spatial, social, and hypothetical distance—and immersion are introduced to identify the mechanism. Through a two (with versus without metaphor) by two (with versus without board writing) between-subject experimental design, 193 participants were randomly assigned to one of four sets of video lectures on the gradient descent method, followed by an online questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to validate the research model. The results demonstrate that metaphor has a significant effect on all four aspects of psychological distance and immersion, while board writing has an impact only on hypothetical distance. Social distance mediates the relationship between metaphor and learning performance, recommendation intention, and continuance intention; hypothetical distance mediates the interplay between metaphor, board writing, and learning performance; and immersion mediates the link between metaphor and recommendation intention.}

The existing literature on game jam learning consists mostly of descriptive individual case studies, with very incohesive and varied research aims, methods, and settings. Thus far, there have been no attempts to further analyze and classify the reported results of the previous studies. This article looks at existing research on game jams and learning, comparing the reported learning results to the future-oriented skills and knowledge. The data set, created utilizing the PRISMA checklist, consists of 25 original articles published between 2010 and 2022. The results show that participation in a game jam event will likely increase interdisciplinary, epistemic, and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, it can increase disciplinary knowledge depending on the theme and other framings of the event. Participation in a game jam event will likely further cognitive and metacognitive skills as well as social and emotional skills, provided the jam event is organized to create a safe and inclusive space for learning. Participation in a game jam will also likely further diverse practical and physical skills, but the adoption of these skills varies depending on individuals’ tasks inside their team. ICT-related skills are furthered in jam events concentrating on digital games and can be supported when making non-digital games. Thus, game jams offer a well-suited method for learning future-oriented skills and knowledge.}

abstract = {In the realm of knowledge transmission, organizations face the challenge of finding effective strategies to engage individuals and facilitate knowledge transfer. Traditional methods often fall short, failing to capture individuals’ attention and ignite their motivation to actively participate in the knowledge transmission process. This article introduces Colearnis, a novel knowledge transmission platform, which allows peers to transfer knowledge in a gamified manner by using videos and quizzes which are directly created by the employees. This article also presents a long-term field study investigating the use of Colearnis with 130 employees in a worldwide metallurgy and tooling company. A multi-dimensional evaluation approach makes use of user surveys and behavior-tracking data to explore prospective avenues which might benefit knowledge transmission. Users have been profiled under demographical and managerial aspects, however also under their gamification user types according to the Hexad framework for gamification design. This study explores the connections between user profiles and engagement behaviors within Colearnis. The findings suggest that factors such as; age influence the achiever and philanthropist user types, however also that individuals with greater managerial duties are more likely to be classified as socializer, free-spirit, or philanthropist user types. Additionally, this study suggests that socializer or disruptor user types are more likely to consume or react to peers’ self-created knowledge. On the other hand, achiever user profiles are less likely to react or start quizzes. These findings equip organizations with valuable insights to further design and implement engaging ad-hoc knowledge transmission systems. These systems could be further tailored to align with individuals’ managerial profiles and gamification user types, optimizing engagement and increasing the likelihood of successful knowledge transmission.}

Distributed smart microgrid technology allows for the efficient integration of sustainable resources to provide localised energy delivery at improved levels of reliability and resilience. Smart energy management in decentralised renewable systems requires computational intelligence to implement pivotal energy-aware/cost-aware procedures in decision-making for a conceptualised next generation Smart Village microgrid platform. Smart Village microgrid control automation aims at offering pragmatic and, intelligent control capabilities to perform price-based demand response energy management. This paper proposes the use of cascaded control abstraction in the implementation of a price-sensitive cyber-physical Smart Grid approach in a rural off-grid microgrid environment. The modular microgrid design integrates renewable energy resources through an adaptive control algorithm developed in a model-based design approach. The solution is based on distributed market-based control, using multi-agent transactive principles to navigate automated demand response. Multi-priority load clusters with the selective parallel control of non-intelligent device groups allow for prioritised supply/demand resource coordination. The proposed Smart Village solution operates as a self-regulating smart microgrid energy management system and by virtue of its market-based transactive reasoning approach is able to meet multiple operating requirements of rural village energy systems. Simulation results for this value-based control technique highlight the value of customer engagement combined with supply-, demand- and economic cost optimisation for hybrid renewable distributed energy microgrids.}

To help address the uneven distribution of these components, we developed four DC inclusive science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) books related to the topic of energy. These books were designed with the DCF to foster rich DC learning experiences in school science. We engaged 13 teachers as consultants in a validation process when developing the DC inclusive STEAM books. This study describes the development and implementation of the DCF for preparing supplemental science curriculum materials that can improve students’ appreciation for DC.

The agency of change is shared between the house and its occupants, most notably Truus Schröder, who lived in the house for 60 years. This paper takes a material engagement approach to explore the relation between the occupant and the house and speculates how this might be a model for designers of contemporary and future robotic architecture to rethink concepts of autonomy and agency in building cognition.}

From the resulting analysis of 49 studies, this study investigates the contextual characteristics by AI-supported interaction type, AI application, target language, educational level, etc. Moreover, three research paradigms are identified in this emerging field, i.e., Paradigm One (AI-directed, teacher-as-facilitator, learner-as-recipient), Paradigm Two (AI/teacher-codirected, learner-as-collaborator), and Paradigm Three (AI/teacher/learner-codirected). The paradigms are induced through analysis of eight constructs: human-AI relationship, learning objective, task type, level of pre-structuring, mode of engagement behavior, knowledge-change process, cognitive outcome, and research focus. The philosophical and linguistic underpinnings for each paradigm are discussed. Additionally, we highlight future research implications including investigating under-researched themes and exploring diverse methodological possibilities and appropriateness among the three research paradigms.}

Due to its advantages, many teachers have participated in online professional development (OPD) in recent years. Numerous studies have investigated the participation and effect of first to 12th grade in-service teachers' OPD participation on the teacher, classroom practice, or student level. However, a comprehensive meta-analysis of these studies is missing. This meta-analysis summarizes findings from 102 quantitative studies with a pre-posttest design. The results indicate medium effects of OPD participation on the teacher level (Hedges' g = 0.71) and on the classroom level (Hedges' g = 0.55) and a small effect on the student level (Hedges' g = 0.19). We included Desimones' (2009) core features of effective PD participation as moderators. We found that the core feature of collective participation positively influenced the effect size of the classroom level. Furthermore, we found that studies that employed a control-group design reported significantly lower effect sizes on teacher-level outcomes than studies that used a within-subject design. On the student's level, studies with asynchronous OPD reported significantly smaller effect sizes than studies with a synchronous OPD format. Our results aim to provide research, policymakers, educational stakeholders, and teachers with the clarity that OPD is effective on several levels and should, therefore, be encouraged.}

Teachers may wonder if their students can attain satisfactory learning performance in an online learning environment without teachers' on-the-spot attention. In order to develop students' skills in programming, promote their enjoyment of learning and intention to learn to program, the researchers integrated two innovative teaching approaches, using online peer-facilitated learning and distributed pair programming, and investigated the effects of these on students' online learning performance. This study conducted an experiment that included 128 undergraduates from four class sections of Department of Finance. Thus, the experimental design in this research was a 2 (Peer-facilitated learning vs. non-peer-facilitated learning) × 2 (Distributed pair programming vs. non-distributed pair programming) factorial pretest/post-test design. The participants in this research mainly consisted of four classes of students from a non-computer or information department who took a compulsory course on programming design.’ Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this study. According to the results, the peer-facilitated learning group exhibited significantly better development of programming skills, enjoyment of learning, and intention to learn, than the non-peer-facilitated learning group. However, expected effects of enhancing the learning of the students in this study who received the distributed pair programming were not found.

The accumulation of publicly available gene expression data for hundreds of plant species, together with advances in bioinformatical methods and affordable computing, sets ingenuity as one of the major bottlenecks in understanding gene function and regulation. Here, we show how a credit card-sized computer retailing for <50 USD can be used to rapidly predict gene function and infer regulatory networks from RNA sequencing data. To achieve this, we constructed a bioinformatical pipeline that downloads and allows quality-control of RNA sequencing data; and generates a gene co-expression network that can reveal enzymes and transcription factors participating and controlling a given biosynthetic pathway. We exemplify this by first identifying genes and transcription factors involved in the biosynthesis of secondary cell wall in the plant Artemisia annua, the main natural source of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. Networks were then used to dissect the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway, which suggest potential transcription factors regulating artemisinin biosynthesis. We provide the source code of our pipeline (https://github.com/mutwil/LSTrAP-Lite) and envision that the ubiquity of affordable computing, availability of biological data and increased bioinformatical training of biologists will transform the field of bioinformatics.

Research experiences can lead to gains in students’ general skills, such as oral visual and written communication, as well as more specific research-associated skills. Traditionally, undergraduates have been introduced to research primarily through the apprentice model, in which undergraduates join a research group and receive one-on-one guidance from a mentor. This model, while effective, limits the number of students who can engage in research experiences and tends to be more accessible to students who are familiar with the research enterprise. There is therefore an increasing emphasis on developing opportunities for students to engage in research in credit-bearing courses, extending the benefits of research experiences to a larger and more diverse group. These course-based research experiences can provide many of the same benefits students derive from traditional undergraduate research experiences, such as increased content knowledge and analytical skills and persistence in science. This chapter describes important characteristics of course-based research experiences and provides examples that range from national programs to single courses developed by individual instructors. We end the chapter by offering practical suggestions to help instructors design an effective course-based research experience.}

abstract = {Generative AI, and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), have gained substantial momentum due to their wide applications in various disciplines. While the use of these game changing technologies in generating textual information has already been demonstrated in several application domains, their abilities in generating complex models and executable codes need to be explored. As an intriguing case is the goodness of the machine and deep learning models generated by these LLMs in conducting automated scientific data analysis, where a data analyst may not have enough expertise in manually coding and optimizing complex deep learning models and codes and thus may opt to leverage LLMs to generate the required models. This paper investigates and compares the performance of the mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, PaLM, LLama, and Falcon, in generating deep learning models for analyzing time series data, an important and popular data type with its prevalent applications in many application domains including financial and stock market. This research conducts a set of controlled experiments where the prompts for generating deep learning-based models are controlled with respect to sensitivity levels of four criteria including (1) Clarify and Specificity, (2) Objective and Intent, (3) Contextual Information, and (4) Format and Style. While the results are relatively mix, we observe some distinct patterns. We notice that using LLMs, we are able to generate deep learning-based models with executable codes for each dataset separately whose performance are comparable with the manually crafted and optimized LSTM models for predicting the whole time series dataset. We also noticed that ChatGPT outperforms the other LLMs in generating more accurate models. Furthermore, we observed that the goodness of the generated models vary with respect to the “temperature” parameter used in configuring LLMS. The results can be beneficial for data analysts and practitioners who would like to leverage generative AIs to produce good prediction models with acceptable goodness.}

Through this single-case study design, the study examined the learning experiences of a group of teachers engaged in interactive, inquiry-based professional learning focused on math, making and coding during a shift to emergency remote teaching. The primary objective was to identify promising practices for online professional learning (PL) focused on math and coding using a maker-pedagogies approach to teaching and learning, based on the teachers’ learning experiences. Study participants included 20 teachers from a rural school board in Northern Ontario, Canada. Findings indicated that the following may be considered as promising practices when developing and implementing virtual math and coding PL from a maker perspective. It is important to: a) balance sessions focused on specific math and coding content with more general sessions focused on learning the various maker-technology tools; b) include both synchronous and asynchronous learning opportunities for the variety of teachers involved in the learning; c) include collaborative learning in the teacher PL and a virtual platform that can support this type of social learning; d) ensure the PL sessions are on-going as opposed to one-off or isolated sessions. This research suggests that online professional learning sessions need to consider three elements: the teacher, the content, and the learning environment and offers important recommendations for future work in this area.}

abstract = {Recently, the term “fake news” has been broadly and extensively utilized for disinformation, misinformation, hoaxes, propaganda, satire, rumors, click-bait, and junk news. It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a new system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to generate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy are the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were indeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We compared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be more sensitive in discovering fake news items.}

Fourteen portable wave flumes were designed, fabricated, and delivered to high schools along the East Coast of the United States from New Jersey to Florida. The ∼5 m long flume consists of a motor-controlled wave paddle at one end and a sediment-surrogate beach at the other end for hands-on activities for coastal dynamics. Sensors for measuring water level and fluid velocity and education modules ranging from basic wave concepts to applications such as beach nourishment are provided to teachers to assist in education delivery. Pre- and post-module worksheets and overall program surveys are used as assessment instruments to gauge effectiveness of the program. The student and teacher assessment results indicate that the portable wave flumes and associated modules were successful in helping students understand coastal processes in an engaging and hands-on manner. All teachers surveyed indicated that they plan to use the flume again. Modifications in the future may include creating lesson plans with more open-ended questions to encourage student exploration, decreasing the apparatus footprint, and using an actuator-controlled wave paddle for irregular wave forcing.}

In this case study, we explored how a maker program integrated with real-world problems fostered four dimensions of students’ creativity and three areas of students’ entrepreneurship from the perspective of the 5E learning cycle. Seventy Grade 9 students (15–16 years old) from a K–12 school in Hong Kong participated in the 5-month maker program. Curriculum documents, activity video recordings, interviews, and student digital media products were collected to facilitate data triangulation. The qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The study found that the students’ creativity and entrepreneurship were scaffolded in a variety of ways throughout the learning cycle.

Computational pathology is burgeoning subspecialty in pathology that promises a better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, computational pathology faces several challenges, including the ability to integrate raw data from different sources, limitation of hardware processing capacity, and a lack of specific training programs, as well as issues on ethics and larger societal acceptable practices that are still solidifying. The establishment of the entire industry of computational pathology requires far-reaching changes of the three essential elements connecting patients and doctors: the local laboratory, the scan center, and the central cloud hub/portal for data processing and retrieval. Computational pathology, unlocked through information integration and advanced digital communication networks, has the potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality, and ultimately create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients.

A needs-based approach is desirable for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, and to link pharmaceutical education with the health needs of populations and national priorities. There are varying levels of data in the literature on the status of pharmaceutical education in all six World Health Organization (WHO) regions, especially in the context of needs identification and evidence-based policy interventions. The framework for this study was the FIP Development Goals.
Objectives
The aim of the study was to develop evidence-based policies through a needs-based approach for pharmaceutical education transformation nationally, regionally and globally by addressing the following objectives: 1. Identify global and regional needs in pharmaceutical education, through a regional SWOT analysis and prioritization of FIP development goals; 2. Develop valid and credible regional roadmaps for pharmaceutical education advancement according to the identified prioritized goals and 3. Develop a global call to action as a policy intervention for advancing pharmaceutical education.
Methods
This study was conducted between 2020 and 2021 using a mixed methods approach. Surveys of higher education institutions and a series of qualitative interviews were conducted with national professional leadership organizations, with further regional workshops having 284 participants recruited from the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) membership base, spanning all six WHO regions.
Results
Eleven out of 21 FIP DGs were identified as priorities for regional roadmaps and FIP DG 1 (Academic capacity) was identified as a priority in four regions. All regions had distinctive results with an area of commonality between them. There were common weaknesses in the adoption of competency-based education and inter-professional education.
Conclusions
It is critical for every country and region to develop needs- and evidence-based policies for the transformation of pharmaceutical education, for which FIP DGs provide a systematic framework.}

abstract = {An engaging first programming class (CS1) often inspires students’ passion for computer science (CS). However, the evidence in the literature suggests that the average CS1 classes are anything but engaging for many students. The performance of CS compared to other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in international student engagement surveys seems to substantiate CS1 failure, attrition rates, and lack of diversity in most CS classes. Meanwhile, for its simplicity in introducing programming to beginners, primary and secondary schools use Scratch, an educational programming environment developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. For the same reason, higher institutions now include some forms of Scratch instruction in CS1. The question remains, to what extent is Scratch engaging, especially for students in higher education? This study addressed this gap by observing college computer science students exposed to a constructionist Scratch programming pedagogy. We adopted a descriptive design based on quantitative observations. To observe the class during a weekly 2-hour session, we employed five CS educators, one observer per week. Each observer, employing a 20-item observation protocol, rated the extent of affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of first-year CS students in a polytechnic in North Central Nigeria. Most of the students were learning to program for the first time. Analysis of the data showed a significant agreement in the ratings of the five observers for overall student engagement, although the impact was moderate. However, while agreement in their ratings for affective engagement was significant, with a large effect, there was no significant concordance in their ratings for behavioral engagement. Observers also significantly agreed in their ratings for cognitive engagement; however, the impact was moderate. These findings suggest that employing Scratch in higher education can be engaging and useful, especially for students with no prior programming experience.}

The findings demonstrate that technology-enabled TPD programs could develop teachers’ knowledge and skills critical to quality teaching during the pandemic and create environments that foster active learning and collaboration among teachers. However, there needs to be significant improvements in using technology to provide expert support and facilitate feedback and reflections. Furthermore, equity and efficiency were not specifically discussed in these TPD programs.

However, much of the software tools currently available are still designed around a laptop programming paradigm that tends to restrict collaboration rather than encourage shifting of roles and sharing of experiences. This paper explores how to design tools that invite collaborative interactions, in particular how mobile software tools, with heavy usage of video as an interactive resource, could allow for collaborative sketching and understanding. Based on contextual inquiries with educators, observations and engagements with students in classroom settings, and a workshop with Arduino Education, this paper sketches out a vision for how the software tools used for learning physical computing can be re-designed to better work within the context of group work from the observations, for groups of students aged 14–16-years old.}

Our findings suggest that teachers valued the MCVT toolkit as a resource for their own learning and perceived the cards to be useful for supporting new computational practices, specifically for learning through making and connecting to examples of everyday computing. Critically reviewed by teachers during codesign workshops, the toolkit however posed some implementation challenges and constraints for learning through making and troubleshooting circuitry. From teacher surveys, interviews, workshop video recordings, and teacher-constructed projects, we show how teachers codesigned new design prototypes and pedagogical activities while also adapting and extending paper-based computing materials so their students could take advantage of the unique technical and expressive affordances of MCVT Cards. Our design research contributes a new perspective on using interactive paper computing cards as a medium for instructional materials development to support more inclusive computing education.}

The results showed that dynamic feedback, with feedback contents appropriately adjusted to the task difficulty levels (i.e., simple hints after easy game tasks and detailed explanations after difficult game tasks), were more effective in enhancing students' learning achievement and gaming engagement. Furthermore, we also found that providing detailed explanations after both easy and difficult game tasks led to a decrease in learners' engagement.

However, researchers often broadly categorize GBL without specific attention to teachers' practices or the different game-based pedagogies (GBPs) such as serious game-based learning and learning by making games. Serious game-based learning involves the use of games designed primarily for purposes beyond entertainment, engaging students in learning activities. Learning by making games goes further by enabling students to construct and expand their knowledge through creative activities. Furthermore, the impact of students' weekly gaming hours on their academic performance under different GBPs has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-science unit assessment data to investigate the effects of serious game-based learning and learning by making games, along with gaming hours, on the science learning outcomes of 129 sixth-grade students in a Midwestern urban school district in the United States. Employing Bayesian paired t-tests and ANOVA, we examined the effects of two GBPs (serious game learning and game-making) implemented by two science teachers and the interaction between each GBP and students' weekly gaming hours. Our findings indicate that both GBPs led to improvements in students’ learning, with those participating in making games showing an average increase of 3.5 points more on the posttests than those engaged in serious game-based learning. Additionally, data on student-reported weekly gaming hours showed that in both GBP conditions, students with medium gaming hours showed the most improvement compared to those with fewer or more gaming hours. There was also a potential interaction between types of GBP and the effect of gaming hours outcomes in that the learning gain difference between the two GBPs was more pronounced among students reporting fewer gaming hours, although this effect was not significant. This study contributes to the GBL field by providing practical design recommendations for integrating GBL into formal Kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12) settings, taking into account teachers' pedagogical agency and students' gaming experiences.}

This research investigates traditional principles of urban planning of ancient Beijing, based on examples on the historical map Qianlong Jingcheng Quantu, to derive the lost design rules. These rules are used to build up a procedural modelling framework, which reveals the development of Beijing's urban structure from the Yuan (1271–1368) to the Qing (1644–1911) dynasty. Our findings present a grammar incorporated into the procedural modelling framework to parametrically generate Hutong neighbourhoods, which replicates the morphological characteristics of historic cases. It contributes to the understanding of the generation of Hutong neighbourhoods. In support of heritage sustainability, this grammar can be implemented in a computational environment by visual scripting that enables the generation of new instances of Hutong neighbourhoods, both real and virtual.}

Inspired by previous cognitive studies which have evidenced that feelings of surprise and familiarity affect the learning process, the hypothesis of this research is that robot-tutors will increase student's enjoyment. Leading the research to question whether higher levels of enjoyment strongly correlate with a higher acquisition of knowledge through a series of three experiments. Using the same subject material, three variables were tested: 1. one robot-tutor lecture, 2. one human-tutor lecture, 3. two robot-tutor lectures. Initial findings showed that students lectured by a human-tutor once, acquired a higher level of knowledge compared to those lectured by a robot-tutor once. However, those in the robot-tutor lecture shared higher levels of enjoyment as well as increased expressions of surprise. When students were lectured by a robot-tutor for the second time, results showed both a higher level of acquired knowledge and enjoyment and a drop in expressed surprise, compared to both, one human-tutor lecture and one robot-tutor lecture or one robot-tutor lecture. We conclude that high levels of surprise distracted students initially but once overcome, acted as motivation to study.}

Problems concerning negative preconceptions and the limited usage of this form of AI have been reported, as some teachers perceive it as a competitor. This is due to insufficient readiness for its integration and a lack of understanding of how it can facilitate teaching innovation. Due to this, the researchers applied a bisymmetric approach, where necessity conditional analysis (NCA) as a symmetrical approach employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for language teachers' passing accountability, while PLS-SEM as an asymmetrical approach follows additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to helping them to pass their accountability. Applying this approach would generate more results from different perspectives in ChatGPT readiness and language teaching innovation with it. In this line, the researchers randomly explored 124 Iranian in-service language teachers ChatGPT readiness and their teaching innovation in helping them pass the external and internal language teaching competencies. The result of the PLS-SEM showed that the more the language teachers were ready to practically use ChatGPT alongside, aware of its opportunities and challenges in English language teaching (ELT), the more they could generate more language teaching methods and approaches with it, apply them to their language teaching procedures, and share them with their colleagues. Moreover, their generational language teaching methods with ChatGPT mediated the correlation between ChatGPT readiness and meeting internal accountability. Additionally, the NCA showed that the generation of language teaching methods with ChatGPT and their implementation through it were among the necessary factors that help language teachers meet both internal and external accountability by teaching language with ChatGPT. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that stakeholders shift their focus from AI programming to AI teaching, especially for ELT.}

abstract = {Diabetes is one of the deadliest and costliest diseases. Today, automatic diabetes detection systems are primarily developed using deep learning (DL) approaches, which give high accuracy in classifying patients into two classes: have diabetes or not. Unfortunately, DL is a high-complexity and unexplainable black-box model. This paper proposes a new nearest neighbor-based framework to tackle those issues in classifying two diabetes datasets: binary-class Pima India Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and multiclass Diabetes Type. A k-means clustering (KMC) is first carried out to remove the noises or outliers and keep the competent data in the training set. The dimension of the competent data is then reduced using an autoencoder (AE) to minimize the distances of the intra-class data but maximize that of the inter-class. A k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and two variants: pseudo nearest neighbor rule (PNNR) and local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN), are used to detect diabetes. In addition, a new variant named multi-voter multi-commission nearest neighbor (MVMCNN) is introduced. An investigation based on 5-fold cross-validation (FCV) informs that, for binary-class PIDD, the proposed combination of KMC, AE, and MVMCNN achieves the highest accuracy of 99.13%, which is slightly higher than the state-of-the-art DL-based detection model that produces 98.07%. An evaluation based on 10-FCV also indicates that, for the multiclass Diabetes Type, it obtains a higher accuracy of 95.24% than the DL-based model for predicting diabetes that gives 94.02%.}

abstract = {Developing interdisciplinary undergraduate courses is challenging at all levels; it requires involving trained faculty who can successfully cover more than one discipline and creating a new curriculum that crosses discipline boundaries. While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results. This study also includes more recent approaches to teaching computational neuroscience using cloud computing.}

abstract = {Blended learning offers a learner-centred approach that employs both in-class learning and digital technology to facilitate online learning. Such an approach is especially advantageous to adult-learners in higher education as it meets their educational needs. However, adult-learners’ participation in blended learning programmes remains challenging due to a general lack of online interaction, and no clear teaching strategies that address this concern. Literature relating to adult-learners’ educational needs and online interaction was consulted in order to design teaching strategies that foster adult-learners’ online interaction. The aim of this study is to further validate these teaching strategies, hence a multiple case study was carried out using a mixed method approach. As such, eight teachers and sixteen students from four courses across three universities in Belgium and the Netherlands were interviewed. Additionally, a questionnaire testing a pre-defined set of variables was distributed to 84 students. The results lead to a set of validated teaching strategies that help teachers to further develop their professional skills and expertise. The teaching strategies can be grouped into three categories, namely 1) the teacher's online presence, 2) collaborative learning activities and preparatory learning activities, and 3) the distribution of learning content and learning activities across online and in-class learning. An elaborate set of validated teaching strategies is included. This study aids towards teacher professional development and adds evidence-based knowledge to teaching strategies and instructional frameworks for adult-learners in higher education.

This study explores the impacts of Connect Science, a service-learning (SL) program developed to enhance elementary students' energy literacy in the United States. Program impacts were explored within the context of a randomized controlled trial. Teachers in the SL intervention group were provided with professional development, coaching and curricular materials. Each fourth grade class chose an energy problem to address, and designed projects to test out a solution. Teachers in a waitlist control group taught their typical energy unit. Upon completion of the unit, students were asked to write about a problem related to energy production or use and propose a potential solution. Inductive content analysis was used to code 703 student responses (377 from control group and 326 from SL group). The majority of students expressed concerns about wasting or using too much electricity or the use of nonrenewable energy sources. Solutions focused on energy conservation and the use of renewable or clean resources were mentioned most frequently overall. Students in the SL group were significantly more likely to mention environmental impacts of various energy sources and to suggest energy conservation solutions or educating others. Conversely, the control group student responses more often focused on electric circuits or electrical safety. Results from this study suggest the promise of environmental SL programs to advance energy literacy and promote critical thinking about how to address energy problems.}

In the simulator, numerical algorithms were implemented based on a theoretical framework, such as fugacity test, bracketing methods, and the calculation of residual properties. EoS Simulator can estimate two-phase envelopes, isobars, isotherms, and surfaces related to PTVHS properties. MATLAB Grader courses were proposed to test student learning using the software in two different workshops. The evaluation was based on the achievement of tasks related to intended learning outcomes. Survey responses about the simulator and learning environment were collected, concluding that most students improved their skills in understanding thermodynamics phenomena, but some improvements are necessary for future versions of the software and online courses.}

However, there are still issues with inconsistent results in professional domain applications, with low-resource learning being a considerable problem. This paper proposes a language processing model for historical education built using BERT's pre-training techniques. Two experiments were conducted to obtain comparative results and choose the appropriate model method for explicating implicit expertise in secondary school history teaching. It compares traditional methods, represented by naive Bayes, to popular continuation pre-processing techniques such as domain adaptive learning and task adaptive learning to improve the effectiveness of transfer learning. Finally, this study builds targeted models based on real application needs and selects professional rules consistent with the scene application. The use of continued pre-training helps to enhance the accuracy of the professional domain model.}

Due to the numerous types of distortions and unclarified distortion-structure relations, a quantitative distortion manipulation for the desired crystalline phase of perovskite materials suitable for various application remains challenging. Here, by establishing parameter sets to systematically describe the types, magnitudes and positional relations involved in distortions, we are able to interpret the structural regulations and manipulation strategies in 7 reported crystal systems. Through the construction of distortion-phase-property functional curves, we further propose a paradigm to quantify the structural distortion manipulation for desired perovskite phases. Using the example of perovskite-like tungsten oxides, we successfully quantify their volume shrinkage and symmetry increase during lithiation. This work verifies that the complicated research and development of perovskite materials can be simplified into a mathematical problem solving process, which will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to participate, especially mathematicians and computer scientists.}

The Alpha, Beta, and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) co-circulated globally during 2020 and 2021, fueling waves of infections. They were displaced by Delta during a third wave worldwide in 2021, which, in turn, was displaced by Omicron in late 2021. In this study, we use phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of VOCs worldwide. We find that source-sink dynamics varied substantially by VOC and identify countries that acted as global and regional hubs of dissemination. We demonstrate the declining role of presumed origin countries of VOCs in their global dispersal, estimating that India contributed <15% of Delta exports and South Africa <1%–2% of Omicron dispersal. We estimate that >80 countries had received introductions of Omicron within 100 days of its emergence, associated with accelerated passenger air travel and higher transmissibility. Our study highlights the rapid dispersal of highly transmissible variants, with implications for genomic surveillance along the hierarchical airline network.}

Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue’s readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue.}

We propose a solution to the challenges of obtaining relevant eye-tracking information in a dynamic 3D virtual environment and calculating interpretable indicators of learning and social behavior. With a method called "gaze-ray casting," we simulated 3D-gaze movements to obtain information about the gazed objects. This information was used to create graphical models of visual attention, establishing attention networks. These networks represented participants' gaze transitions between different entities in the VR environment over time. Measures of centrality, distribution, and interconnectedness of the networks were calculated to describe the network structure. The measures, derived from graph theory, allowed for statistical inference testing and the interpretation of participants' visual attention in 3D VR environments. Our method provides useful insights when analyzing students’ learning in a VR classroom, as reported in a corresponding evaluation article with N = 274 participants. •Guidelines on implementing gaze-ray casting in VR using the Unreal Engine and the HTC VIVE Pro Eye.•Creating gaze-based attention networks and analyzing their network structure.•Implementation tutorials and the Open Source software code are provided via OSF: https://osf.io/pxjrc/?view_only=1b6da45eb93e4f9eb7a138697b941198.}

We provide a detailed case study of two students as they encoded outcomes in their work on several related counting problems within a computational setting. We highlight the role that a computational environment may have played in this encoding activity. We illustrate ways in which by-hand work and computer programming worked together to facilitate the students’ successful encoding activity. This case demonstrates ways in which the activity of computation seemed to interact with by-hand work to facilitate sophisticated encoding of outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
COVID-19 prompted a global shift to online learning, including video conference-assisted online learning (VCAOL), which necessitated educators understanding students' perspectives.
Objective
This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) model-agnostic interpretability that could predict students' academic performance in VCAOL.
Material and methods
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and data augmentation were used to handle imbalanced data from small-scale datasets. The prediction model was developed using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). SHAP model-agnostic interpretability was used to interpret and comprehend prediction findings. The data was gathered from September 2022 to January 2023, resulting in 361 records. The research variables included students' academic performance as the dependent variable, and the video conference application (VC), learning material (LM), internet connection (IC), students' ability to learn (SL), and student knowledge (SK) as independent variables, which were mapped into 28 attributes.
Result
The SMOTE improved the performance of three algorithms, with RF outperforming SVM and GNB in almost all tests, achieving an accuracy of 79.45%, precision of 75.71%, and recall of 79.45%. SHAP bar plots ranked attributes by importance demonstrated that “Performance,” “Frequency Constraint,” and “Increase Value” had a significant impact on prediction results. When we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we determined that SK and SL were the most important views for students to perform well in VCAOL. SHAP's beeswarm revealed students' performance in VCAOL was positively correlated with “Performance”, “Increase Value”, “Completing Project”, “Adequate Method”, “User Interface”, and “Feature”. As we mapped the three attributes to our study perspective, we found that SK, LM, SL, and VC were positively related to students' performance in VCAOL.
Conclusion
The study highlighted the potential of ML in developing data-driven decision-making tools for predicting students' academic performance and identifying critical attributes in a prediction model.}

Professional developers of parallel software think in terms of parallel design patterns, which are markedly different from traditional (sequential) design patterns. It follows that the more we can teach students to think in terms of parallel patterns, the more their thinking will resemble that of parallel software professionals. In this paper, we present patternlets—minimalist, scalable, syntactically correct programs, each designed to introduce students to a particular parallel design pattern. The collection currently includes 44 patternlets (16 MPI, 17 OpenMP, 9 Pthreads, and 2 heterogeneous), of which we present a representative sample. We also present data that indicate the use of patternlets to introduce parallelism in CS2 produced a modest improvement in student understanding of parallel concepts.}
